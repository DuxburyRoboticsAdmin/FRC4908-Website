        <div class="col-md-10"><h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Founded in 2012, Duxbury Robotics originated as a co-curricular club. Duxbury Robotics has since grown into a team. Starting in 2014, the team competes in the FIRST Robotics Competition as team 4908. The team is now over forty students strong, and the team is still growing. While Duxbury Robotics is young, it has accomplished a great deal in its short existence. Including winning a series of rookie awards in its first year competing in the FIRST Robotics Competition.<p>

        <div class="col-md-10"><h2>Our Future</h2>
            <p>&emsp;&emsp;Duxbury Robotics is poised to grow as the program becomes a deeply rooted institution within the town of Duxbury. Over the past several years, the presence of Duxbury Robotics has created a superior environment for the patronage of STEM. In the future, Duxbury Robotics will be able to serve more students increasing its influence on the student population, and opening many opportunities for students which would otherwise not be available to them.</p>
