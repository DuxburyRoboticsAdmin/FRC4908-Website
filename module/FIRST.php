<h1 class="lead">What is FIRST? </h1>
<p>FIRST is an international organization, which organizes educational competitions for students of all ages. The acronym F.I.R.S.T. stands for “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.” The organization runs a series of unique competitions to engage students of all ages. Through the FIRST Lego League, and Junior Lego League, young elementary and middle school aged children are introduced to robotics and compete at FIRST organized events. Through the FIRST Tech Challenge, students from 7th through 12th grade build and compete using robots built with standard parts. However, Duxbury Robotics competes exclusively in another FIRST organized competition: the FIRST Robotics Competition, FIRST’s flagship competition.</p>

<h1 class="lead">What is the FIRST Robotics Competition?</h1>
<p>The varsity Sport for the Mind™, FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, teams are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program robots to perform prescribed tasks against a field of competitors.  It’s as close to "real-world engineering" as a student can get. Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.<sup>1</sup></p>
