# Duxbury Robotics Wesbite #

All of the HTML, CSS and PhP needed for duxburyrobotics.com

### How do I get set up? ###

Download latest master branch

Make sure PhP 4.x is installed

The live server uses Apache, PhP and MYSQL. You don't need to run the website 
like this. In development we run the website using IntelilJ's built-in service
or with ```php -S localhost:80```. Really, any web server/service will do. 


### Branches ###
- *Master* - the live website. This is what's avalible to the public.

- *dev* - Dev branch is for development stuff and things that are a work in progress. 

- *admin* - This is where the administration related stuff will now be heald.
