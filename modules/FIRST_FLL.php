        <p>Duxbury Middle School currently runs two FLL teams, Duxbury Dragons 1 & 2. We recently competed at the FLL Qualifier at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). One of the teams won the Judge's award for best project. While our teams sadly did not qualify for the state championship we had an awesome time and a great learning experience. </p>
