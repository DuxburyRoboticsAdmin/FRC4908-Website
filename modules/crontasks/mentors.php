                               <p class="list-group-item-text">David G. Price was the former Dean of Aviation Sciences at Daniel Webster College in New Hampshire and Bridgewater State University in Massachusetts. As an enthusiastic aviation and robotics educator for more than 20 years, David joined MS Aerial in 2015 to combine his love of aviation with his love of robotics.
 
From 1994-1997, David hosted a television program called "Take Off" which was geared toward teaching aviation to students coast-to-coast.  In 1998 David was inspired by the television show to stop flying professionally and focus on teaching.  David taught Physics, AP Physics, Robotics and Aviation Science in southern New Hampshire until 2008.  David went back to college academia in 2008 as a professor, where his specialty is teaching Private Pilot concepts.

However, it was during the ten years teaching Physics that David fell in love with F.I.R.S.T. Robotics - an international robot competition in which David began coaching a team before he became the Master of Ceremonies at the world championship each year.  He has been the Master of Ceremonies for more than 15 years now.

David is a graduate of Daniel Webster College with a B.S. in Aviation Management as well as an MBA.  David is a certified Advanced Ground Instructor and was honored at the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics as the 2006 teacher of the Year as well as the Federal Aviation Administration's 2006 Teacher of the Year. David is the past President of the Massachusetts Aviation and Space Education Council (MASEC) as well as a founding officer of the New Hampshire Aviation and Space Education Council (NHASEC). During the summer months, David directs Aviation Career Education (ACE) Camps for the Federal Aviation Administration throughout Massachusetts and New Hampshire and is an active member of the National Association of Flight Instructors (NAFI).

                               <p class="list-group-item-text">Mr. Ferguson has begun his first season with the robotics program at DHS. He has helped guide members of the business and marketing departments as well as add leadership training to the team captains. His hobbies include watching Boston Celtics games, wearing Boston Celtics merchandise, and dreaming of trade scenarios in which Boston Celtics GM Danny Ainge could improve the team. Away from the court Mr. Ferguson likes to wear sweaters in the Winter, T- shirts in the Summer, and baseball caps in the Fall and Spring. His favorite movie of all time is Predator, directed by John McTiernan, and starring two future United States Governors.  He is excited to be apart of such a great program and can't wait to take on the world this season with the team.</p>
