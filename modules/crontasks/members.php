He was able to make the team look more professional with his website design. He was also played a key role during Engineering Week for the local elementary school. This year he plans on making the website even better, help with robot code, and promote the team. He's currently a lifeguard at two local pools, coaches a middle school Water Polo team, and volunteers regularly at multiple organizations. He has worked on filming multiple town hall meetings and even helped film the Plymouth Thanksgiving Parade. He's currently taking AP Computer Science and is looking into an programming independent study in his Junior year second semester. He's also a multiple Best of the Bunch reward recipient, SUMMA recipient, and an honors student. Kyle is very interested in entering a career in one of the STEM fields. He's looking into schools such as Waterloo, RIT, and Carleton and plans on majoring in Computer Science.</p>

In his spare time, he enjoys jogging, as well as studying news and politics with the high school's Global Engagement Club. He also volunteers at the middle school to help the robotics team. From time to time, Teddy will see a lecture in Rhode Island at the Watson institute, and he has gone to the iDtech camps for many years in order to create a video game in one week. He has built his own computer and loves to use it to play high graphic video games. Teddy is an aspiring console inventor, creative director of video games, and hopeful multibillionaire.

During the team’s first year, he became the lead scout and a drive coach in addition to responsibilities on the mechanical team. During the team’s second year, Piers served in a deputy role in the mechanical team and as a driver. In these positions, he gained experience in both working under stress and communicating ideas effectively and concisely. This year he can be found as the Director of Operations. Piers is also an active member of the school community. He is in his second year of sailing for the Varsity Sailing Team, plays the cello in the string ensemble, and is the Student Member of the Duxbury School Committee. In the future, he plans to continue his involvement with FIRST into adulthood and study engineering in college.</p>

In his spare time, he and his friends made a functioning go kart from scratch that reached a top speed of 47mph. He has his own small metal working shop with welders and a forge for blacksmithing. This year he will be using these tools to complete whatever small tasks the team needs.
