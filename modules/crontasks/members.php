                <p class="list-group-item-text">Kyle started in his sophomore year of High School. He helped program the robot and developed the website from scratch last year. He was able to make the team look more professional with his website design. He was also played a key role during Engineering Week for the local elementary school. This year he plans on making the website even better, help with robot code, and promote the team. He's currently a lifeguard at two local pools, coaches a middle school Water Polo team, and volunteers regularly at multiple organisations. He's worked on filming multiple town hall meetings and even helped film the Plymouth Thanksgiving Parade. He's currently taking AP Computer Science and is looking into an programming independent study in his Junior year second semester. He's also a multiple Best of the Bunch reward recipient, SUMMA recipient, and an honors student. Kyle is very interested in entering a career in one of the STEM fields. He's looking into schools such as Waterloo, RIT, and Carleton and plans on majoring in Computer Science.</p>

                <p class="list-group-item-text">Teddy is starting his first year with the DHS robotics, but this is not his first time on a robotics team. In his first year with the DMS robotics team, the team's robot received an honorary mention from the First Lego League thanks to his contributions. Teddy spent three years total in the Duxbury Middle School First Lego League team. In his spare time, he enjoys jogging, as well as studying news and politics with the high school's Global Engagement Club. He also volunteers at the middle school to help the robotics team. From time to time, Teddy will see a lecture in Rhode Island at the Watson institute, and he has gone to the iDtech camps for many years in order to create a video game in one week. He has built his own computer and loves to use it to play high graphic video games. Teddy is an aspiring console inventor, creative director of video games, and hopeful multibillionaire.
