                    <strong>AirCycler®</strong> is a Marshfield, Massachusetts-based electronic design and manufacturing
                    company that develops ventilation systems for residential use. As newer homes are built tighter and
                    more efficiently, it is important that healthy indoor air quality is maintained by regularly bringing
                    in a controlled, measured amount of fresh air. AirCycler ventilation products are developed with
                    innovative algorithms and efficient designs to introduce fresh air to the home without compromising
                    energy efficiency.

                    <strong>The Duxbury Education Foundation (DEF)</strong> works alongside the Duxbury Public Schools to
                    plan events and help the community come together to form a close group. Without their contributions
                    each year, Duxbury Robotics would not be able to compete in any of the FIRST competitions.

                    <strong>F. H. Peterson</strong> is a metal manufacturing company that mainly works with government,
                    military, and NASA contracts. For the 2016 robot, they helped us create CNC parts and even the chassis!
                    This allowed us to make a robot capable of clearing all of the game defenses.
