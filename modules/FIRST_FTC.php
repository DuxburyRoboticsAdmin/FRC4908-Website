            <p style="text-align: center;">We are looking forward to starting a FIRST Tech. Challenge (FTC) Team with the middle school. Currently we have a <a href="/FIRST/FLL" style="display: inline">FIRST Lego League</a> (FLL) team setup but we are looking to move that to the Alden Elementary School. If you have any questions please, feel free to <a href="/contact" style="display: inline">contact us</a>.</p>
