            <div class="col-md-8"><h2>Origins</h2>
                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Founded in 2012, Duxbury Robotics started out as merely a co-curricular club. In 2014,
                    Duxbury Robotics joined FIRST Robotics and the team was officially born! Duxbury Robotics is now
                    known as FRC Team 4908 and competes in the FIRST Robotics Competitions throughout New England.
                    Today, the team is now over forty students strong and still growing. While Duxbury Robotics is young,
                    it has accomplished a great deal in its short existence. In its very first year of competition, team
                    4908 won the Rookie Inspiration Award, the Highest Rookie Seed Award, Rookie All Star Award, as well
                    as winning the UMass Dartmouth event in 2015.

                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Duxbury Robotics continues to grow and add new members each year. Over the past several years,
                    it has created a new and exciting introduction to the world of STEM for a variety of students. The team
                    exposes students to the various fields involved in creating a robot, such as programming, engineering,
                    marketing, and business. Duxbury Robotics has founded a town-wide love of science and technology for all
                    ages and will continue to do so for many years to come.</p>

                            <p>SteamWorks is a unique and difficult challenge.  One of the goal is to score fuel into boilers, in a low or high goal to increase steam pressure.  Another goal is to carry gears to an airship located in the middle of the field to get four different rotors operating for extra points. If all airship rotors are spinning and the boiler steam pressure is at a maximum extra points will be awarded to that alliance. The unique feature of this game is that there will be, for the first time, two human players in each of the airships. </p>

You can see that there stained pieces of wood around the whole robot with our sponsor’s lazered onto it. We also had a very impressive drive system supported by good programing. On the front we had a retractable ball sucker that was very successful. With our design we were able to fit under the low bar along with being able to complete almost all of the defenses. We were also preformed many of the desired functions that are required to win at this game. </p>

                            <p>Strong Hold was a game that was based in medieval time. Each side had a castle that the other team had to shoot these doge balls into. There were places near the ground to shoot along with the three windows that surrounded the top. The goal of the defenses is to slow down the other team’s chances at getting into the shooting zone. Each defense is unique and required different mechanisms and strategies to complete them. Each defense needed to be crossed three times to gain extra points. The goal of the game is to get the most points by the end by shooting and completing defenses. </p>

                                <p>Recycle Rush’s robot was a major engineering feat to get it working! There were two main objects in this game, the boxes and the cylinders. With our teeth we were able to pick up both of these items and stack them accurately. The teeth were attached to the arms that protrude from the robot to grab the game pieces. At our peak we were able to stack 5 boxes with a recycle container on top as well. Our robot’s arms moved up and down on a chain shaft controlled by a motor sims. </p>

                                <p>Arial Assist was a very competitive and fun game, for this we need to be able to move the yoga ball very quickly across the field then shot into a high goal with very good accuracy. For this we had retractable arms that connected at the top and spun to such the yoga ball into the robot. We then would pull those arms back in to store the ball. Once in position, we would spin the wheels the other way to attempt a goal.</p>
