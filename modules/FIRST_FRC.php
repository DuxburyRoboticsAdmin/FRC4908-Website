                <p>&emsp;&emsp;Founded in 2012, Duxbury Robotics started out as merely a co-curricular club. In 2014,
                    Duxbury Robotics joined FIRST Robotics and the team was officially born! Duxbury Robotics is now
                    known as FRC Team 4908 and competes in the FIRST Robotics Competitions throughout New England.
                    Today, the team is now over forty students strong and still growing. While Duxbury Robotics is young,
                    it has accomplished a great deal in its short existence. In its very first year of competition, team
                    4908 won the Rookie Inspiration Award, the Highest Rookie Seed Award, Rookie All Star Award, as well
                    as winning the UMass Dartmouth event in 2015.
