                        We are always looking for experienced engineers to share their knowledge with our students. Professionals
                        offer expertise which is crucial to the learning process.

                    <p>
                        Programming is a fundamental part of robotics without which nothing would work. Computer languages
                        provide the intelligence necessary to complete the tasks required of our robot. Having the help
                        of programmers with experience would greatly help the team.

                    <p>
                        Sponsors are a big part of FIRST since they supply the grants that allow teams to make robots do
                        different things. We would be very grateful if any businesses would like to donate to our team.
